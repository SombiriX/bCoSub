Design Notes:

Implement polymorphism in risk fields
- Decided to use single table inheritance
    - Nullable fields within a single source table
    - Polymorphism is achieved using the property decorator
- Decided against multiple table inheritance
    - It's likely that all fields would be accessed at the same time. This method would require joining on multiple tables when trying to get the fields associated with a given entry
        - Using abstract base class creates redundant data in the DB
        - Not using abstract base class adds an intermediate table which needs inner_join with any query

- Configure webpack-loader per https://medium.com/@jrmybrcf/how-to-build-api-rest-project-with-django-vuejs-part-i-228cbed4ce0c
Need to run './manage.py collectstatic' to pull vue files into django

- Generate ERM using graph_models
    - ./manage.py graph_models -a -g -o ../entity_relation_diagram.png

Issues resolved:
- Webpack config js file does not exists
    - [RESOLUTION] VUE CLI 3 handles webpack configuration internally additional configs need to be added to vue.config.js inside the following:
        module.exports = {
            configureWebpack: {}
        }
    - Additionally main JS needs to remain as is when following the "Configure webpack-loader instructions above"
    - [REF] https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/webpack.html
- ./manage.py runserver only serving blank pages
    - Receiving 404 error for all static files
    - [RESOLUTION] added vue.config.js with entry for "baseUrl: '/static'"
- Vue root object is not attempting to call '/api/risk/' while loading
    - Console showing error "TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined in VueJs"
    - [NOTES] "$http" is defined in vue-resource which is undefined
    - [RESOLUTION] Add and import vue-resource package, also installed bootstrap and css for good measure.
- Attempting to use POST fails with either 403 or 400 error
    - The app needs a CRSF cookie from the server
    - [RESOLUTION] - Installed vue-js-cookie, to get csrf cookie 
- API POST requests fail when v-model is set from text field
    - Setting the value manually works but attempting to get the value from a text field results in the server receiving the default value.
    [RESOLUTION] - Installed vue-js-cookie, to get csrf cookie
- Get 500 Internal server error when trying to save object with foreign key (riskField)
    - Django doesn't know what to do when attempting to create a model object with foreign key relationship.
    - [Resolution] - Added PrimaryKeyRelatedField and create functions to RiskFieldSerializer
- Clicking a chip element causes the chip's text to disappear
    - Passing objects as props causes 2-way binding which leads to undesired/ wierd results
    - [Resolution] - Create new object made of fields from existing object to pass
